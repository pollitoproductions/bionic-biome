🧬 Bionic Biome

Bionic Biome is a compact, arcade-style dungeon crawler built around fast runs, simple mechanics, and replayability. You control a blue orb capable of wielding both melee and ranged weapons while navigating hostile biomes filled with aggressive entities.

The game is intentionally focused, minimal, and designed to feel responsive and learnable within seconds.
